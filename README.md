# Shocknet
Shocknet provides a simple way yet very quick and effective way of creating dedicated servers for GameMaker games.
Shocknet servers are written in Javascript and ran with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) while the clients are made with
[GameMaker Studio 2](http://www.yoyogames.com/).

## Installation
Installing Shocknet is easy. Create a directory for your server and run `npm i shocknet --save` inside of it.

## Getting started
A full guide for getting started is in the works, but for now you should be able to figure out how it all works
by reading through the [example](https://github.com/Ezcha/shocknet-js/blob/master/example.js) and
[documentation](https://shocknet.ezcha.net).

## Documention
Documention for both the client and server sides of Shocknet can be found [here](https://shocknet.ezcha.net).

## Client
The client side scripts for GameMaker Studio 2 can be found in the Marketplace [here](#coming-soon).
